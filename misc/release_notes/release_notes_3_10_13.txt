RELEASE NOTES FOR KOHA 3.10.13
06 Feb 2014
========================================================================

Koha is the first free and open source software library automation package 
(ILS). Development is sponsored by libraries of varying types and sizes, 
volunteers, and support companies from around the world.  
The website for the Koha project is 

    http://koha-community.org/

Koha 3.10.13 can be downloaded from:

    http://download.koha-community.org/koha-3.10.13.tar.gz

Installation instructions can be found at:

    http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Installation_Documentation
    
    OR in the INSTALL files that come in the tarball


Koha 3.10.13 is a security release and fixes four security bugs:

* bug 11660: tools/pdfViewer.pl could be used to read arbitrary
             files on the server
* bug 11661: the staff interface help editor could be used to
             modify or create arbitrary files on the server with
             the privileges of the Apache user
* bug 11662: member-picupload.pl could be used to write to
             arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of
             the Apache user
* bug 11666: the MARC framework import/export function did not
             require authentication, and could be used to perform
             unexpected SQL commands

The fix for bug 11666 removes SQL as a supported format for
importing or exporting MARC frameworks.

We recommend that you upgrade immediately to get the fixes for
these security issues.  However, if you are not able to perform
the upgrade right away, you can mitigate against the issues by
performing the following actions:

* deleting the pdfViewer.pl script
* deleting the member-picupload.pl script
* making edithelp.pl not be executable, e.g., by doing
  "chmod a-x edithelp.pl"
* making import_export_framework.pl not be executable, which will
  disable the MARC framework import and export functionality.

Our thanks to John Lightsey <john@nixnuts.net> for finding and
reporting the issues.

It also includes 7 bugfixes.
